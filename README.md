My First Python Game: Tic Tac Toe! ðŸ§©
Check out my code or give it a try â€” whoâ€™s up for a game of Tic Tac Toe? ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜Š

As a beginner, diving into Python can seem overwhelming. But Iâ€™ve learned that the best way to truly understand a new programming language is by building projects. Hereâ€™s how the project helped me get a deeper understanding of core concepts:

#Variables & Data Types:
I used lists to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. Understanding how to modify and access list elements helped me gain hands-on experience.

#Conditional statements(if/else):
I implemented logic to check for winners and tie conditions using if/else statements. It taught me how to control the flow of a program based on user input.

#Loops:
The game board is displayed repeatedly until there's a winner or tie. Loops were essential for printing the board and waiting for the player's move.

#Functions:
I broke down the game into smaller, manageable pieces using functions like next_turn(), check_winner(),new_game() and empty_spaces(). This helped me understand the importance of functions in organizing code.

ðŸŽ® Using Libraries to Enhance the Game:

tkinter: I used this powerful library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for the game, making it more interactive and fun to play. It helped me explore how to build and manage windows, labels, and buttons.

random: I incorporated the random module to simulate the computerâ€™s moves in a random fashion, providing a challenge to the player.
